# placeholder

Placeholder is an experiment that explores different methods of creating placeholders for images in those fresh interactive wireframes we're all using these days. Hopefully, you will find one of these methods suitable and lightweight for what you're looking for.

Create placeholders by the following methods:

* SASS mixin
* Vanilla Javascript
* Polymer element (using Google's [polymer project](www.polymer-project.org))
